## Introduction to Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to receive instant notifications when events occur in your VB Mgzn documentation projects. This enables real-time integrations with external systems and automated workflows.

const webhookData = {
  url: 'https://yourapp.com/webhook',
  events: ['document.created', 'document.updated'],
  secret: 'your_webhook_secret'
};

fetch('/api/webhooks', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(webhookData)
});
````

## Security and Best Practices

Secure your webhook endpoints and follow best practices to prevent abuse.

| Practice | Description | Benefit |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Verify Signatures | Use webhook secrets to verify payload authenticity | Prevent spoofing attacks |
| Rate Limiting | Implement rate limits on your endpoint | Protect against abuse |
| Error Handling | Handle failures gracefully with retries | Ensure reliable delivery |
